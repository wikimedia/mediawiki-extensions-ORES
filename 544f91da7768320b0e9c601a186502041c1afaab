If not, then you might not need this, in favour of only exposing jqxhr.abort through get().\n\nWhile this exists in core, it\u0027s only very rarely used, and where it is used it is because the consumer would have their own instance, as a shortcut for not needing to track the returned jqxhr.abort callbacks from each get() call.",
