Making this conditional on $oresData like the below probably won\u0027t work (because that\u0027s only set on RC/WL), but maybe it could be part of an RL module instead.\n\nCC @Krinkle for his thoughts.",

While somewhat fragile as long as they can be kept in sync with addModules(), that work work, although it would make it blocking HTML.\n\nWould prefer to turn the relevant module into a FileModule subclass that prepends this config to getScript(), see JQueryMsgModule and LanguageModule in core for examples. It\u0027s a tad ugly, but should get better \"soon\".",
