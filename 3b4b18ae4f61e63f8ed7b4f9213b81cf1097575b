      "message": "This will have occasional oddness with imported revisions (e.g. if $cutoffRevid is an imported rev it will delete more rows than is proper since the rev_id might be very high in spite of the rev_timestamp).\n\nSome JOIN sanity checks in the ores table query might avoid mass deletes due to this. Another option is to use \"NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 from logging WHERE log_type\u003d\u0027import\u0027 AND log_page\u003drev_id AND log_timestamp \u003e\u003d rev_timestamp)\".
