New globals:

$wgOresBaseUrl - API endpoint base URL for ORES requests.  The specific
route and parameters will be appended to this URL.

$wgOresModels - Array of models we want to fetch from the server and cache in
the database.
TODO: Should we default to fetching all available models?

$wgOresDamagingThreshold - Score cutoff above which an edit is flagged as
possibly damaging in the Recent Changes feed.

$wgOresWikiId - Optional database ID for making ORES requests to a different
wiki ID.  An important special name is "testwiki", which accesses a pseudomodel
available for testing without setting up an ORES server to score your wiki.
This pseudomodel will emit scores deterministically correlated to the revision ID,
e.g. https://ores.wikimedia.org/scores/testwiki/reverted/?revids=1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8|9
