New globals:

$wgOresBaseUrl - API endpoint base URL for all ORES requests.  The specific
route will be appended to this URL.

$wgOresModels - Array of models we want to fetch from the server and cache in
the database.

$wgOresRevertTagThresholds - Map from threshold name to score cutoff.  These
thresholds are used to flag recent changes for potential revert.  Must be
listed in ascending order (FIXME).
