New globals:

$wgOresBaseUrl - API endpoint pattern for all ORES requests.  "$wiki" will be
substituted with your wiki's ID.

$wgOresModels - Array of models we want to fetch from the server and cache in
the database.

$wgOresRevertTagThresholds - Map from threshold name to score cutoff.  These
thresholds are used to flag recent changes for potential revert.  Must be
listed in ascending order (FIXME).
