      "message": "I understand in the current version of this tool, patrolled edits are considered non-damaging by definition but this is changing as we offer fine-grained filtering.\n\nI\u0027m inclined to remove it completely. Patrolled is also something that can be controlled in the UI. If the user wants to see damaging edits that have been patrolled, we should let it.",

      "message": "While I think this makes sense generally, I see two issues with it. First, not all users have the right to see patrolled-ness status or filter by it; so for them you would be removing a feature (we are separately considering whether to drop this restriction; I think we should, but it\u0027s not uncontroversial). Second, the logic deciding whether to display the red \"r\" and the colored background skips patrolled edits as well, so you should keep that in sync with this.",
