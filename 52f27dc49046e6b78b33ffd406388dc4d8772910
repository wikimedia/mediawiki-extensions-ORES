Does setTemporaryHook() have a way to clear it, e.g. passing it null from setUp(), or some such?\n\n* This particular test will have the hook set during the RecentChange creation. From looking at this code, I can\u0027t be sure this hook can\u0027t indirectly fire from that, so would be clearer if this were the first statement in this test function.",
