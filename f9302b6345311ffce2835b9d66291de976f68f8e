It does not happen in my local test setup.\n* should probably find the highest threshold, not just the first one that happens to match?\n* wanna go for the extra mile and add it to the .mw-enhanced-rc.mw-collapsible parent too if one exists?",

Don\u0027t ask why it\u0027s like this\nRegarding the second point, it\u0027ll be way faster and we need to make sure thresholds are there in a descending manner and in that case it is the same. I added a comment to explain it.\nRegarding the third part, I think it\u0027s done now.",

Maybe that should be fixed in PHP then, although IMO you are making your life harder by splitting the logic into a largely overlapping frontend and backend part.",
