Which pages is it supposed to work on? Old RC, new RC, contributions, logs, history, new pages/files could all be reasonable targets. What is the format and meaning of the data imported via mw.config?)",

In order to have flexibility and make it more usable, we inject the scores as a config variable to the javascript (see line 21). I know it\u0027s fragile but until we don\u0027t have proper class injected to those diff links, it\u0027s the best option I was able to find.",
