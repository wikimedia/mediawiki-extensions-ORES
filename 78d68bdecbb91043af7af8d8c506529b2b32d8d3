      "message": "Sadly, we don\u0027t have access to any UX people.  But I think I can fix the language rather than the design here, thank you for pointing out the triple negative!  All of the filters are worded to show or hide the items a person doing specialized work is *not* interested in, so I believe my code is consistent with the others.\n\nActually, I\u0027m going to squash with the next commit so that the logic is correct and this all makes more sense.",

It does refer to our internal model however, and correctly reflects what the filter does, so I\u0027m loathe to rename to anything less descriptive.\n\nPlease re-review after I squash with the next commit, so that the logic is consistent with the messages!",
